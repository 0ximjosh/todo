# TODO

Well, not todo, thats just the name of the tool.

`todo` is a cli helper that lets you quickly upload your todos in your code to
linear. I found that my flow was much better when i just put todos in my code
for where i need to work next when iterating really fast, and this lets my team
stay up to date with where im at.

## Install

As of now, unfortunately, this is a typescript script cli tool, when i get more
time i would love to do it in go and add a bunch of features, but o well.

Just clone down the repo and use `bun i && bun link && bun link todo`, and you
should be good to go.

> The first time you run the script, youll be prompted to setup your inital
> config. This is always editable later on if you need.

## Contributions

I just spun this up in an afternoon after getting frustrated with myself for not
using linear enough. There are endless features that could be added to this, and
im open to any PRs.
